Develop a solution that closely matches the screenshots supplied.  Project was done based on screenshots alone.  I did not use any kind of design files (figma/sketch).  Solution was completed using CSS & HTML.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

Worked more with grid instead of relying on flexbox for all layouts.  Had an easier time setting background images vs. the first project I worked on.
